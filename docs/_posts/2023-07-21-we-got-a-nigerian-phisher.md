I guess this is classic phish month, and today we sure have We have a real 
classic amongst us. I was going to talk about another, lesser phishing email,
but when I found this morning a *Nigerian Prince*-class email waiting in my
mailbox, I know I that was the one. 

Ok, this may not be royalty, and I did not 
check if it really originates in Nigeria or just pretends to be. 
But, let's keep my hopes up and say it hails us from the home of the
419 Scam.
Like in the last post, [last post]({% post_url 2023-07-07-phisher-goes-to-venmo  %}),
this is a classic "*I have free money for you but you need to provide 
me some info so I can steal your identity and/or bank account in the 
proccess*" kind of email. 
Different from the aspiring phisher from last post, this one noe only stuck
to the basics but also honored the phishing forefathers. I am just posting the 
text version as it uses no graphics; it needs none:

Niger Delta Development Commission(NDDC)
Port Harcourt, Rivers State

Attention,


It is of pleasure contacting you via email. I came across your contact via the World Trade Center (W.T.C.)   African Regional office, without disclosure of my intentions which is personal.

As an authority here in Niger Delta Development Commission, I noticed  three executed contracts which have not been paid for and the contractors who executed these contracts could not be traced or reached  till this moment.Upon my resumption in the office, I called for internal auditing after hand over, I realized  so many  financial lapses involving   huge  contract sum  amounting to Forty Million , Six Hundred and Fourteen Thousand United States of America Dollars (US$40,614,000 Million), Twenty One Million United States of America Dollars (UDS$21 Million ) and Ten Million, Five Hundred  Thousand (US$10,500,000)  respectively.

I further investigated to find out that these  funds were products of over invoicing  from contractors / companies whom  actually and genuinely were awarded  contracts respectively and they  executed the jobs and were duly paid  with Job completion certificates issued ,but my predecessors  could not move the left over  funds  due to unexpected call for their resignation/removal from the office ( WRONG TIMING).  Since their resignation,Some of them have  secretly and personally approached me  to cover  these transactions  for them by not disclosing to anyone or leave it in the  NDDC accounts/ records  in order not to implicate them, rather , i should  protect their image and   secure these funds for me and my cabinets as these funds have been there and cannot be declared to the Government , if disclosed, some higher authorities  will find ways to  claim it. I have recently discussed  and agreed with the Executive Project Director, Chief Accountant and  Financial Director  to secure and move this fund outside

However, we further noticed that the  companies used in securing these funds respectively were neither  incorporated  as a legal entity with the Corporate Affairs Commission nor registered with Niger Delta Development Commission as contractors, making it difficult to neither function in business nor authorize for contract payment.

I am fully aware of the activities of some unscrupulous people that are currently going on in our world today which you must have been fully acquainted with unpleasant stories, especially this part. But the truth also remains that the world has not been totally invaded by this group of people hence, people can still do businesses together all over the world and further establish healthier personal and business relationships.

Having explained this, I seek your consent to partner with  us and  secure this fund in your name or company's name. All documents shall be legally provided to suit the purpose . As the Chairman  /CEO of Niger Delta Development Commission(NDDC), I cannot risk or gamble with my position. There is no risk whatsoever attached. We will award you with 15% of any secured funds with you and our shares shall  also be invested with you in your country pending when our tenure in the office will elapse.

Kindly get back to me  with your Full name and telephone / mobile number for more details if agreed to work with us.Also, I guarantee that this will be executed under legitimate arrangements that will protect you from any breach of the law.

Thank you.

Yours faithfully,
Dr Samuel Ogboku.

## What makes this phishing email majestic

- Take my word: you have to read through it to appreciate it. This is not 
a half-hearted phishing email like the mediocrity we have been receiving;
this is the kind of well-crafted con we deserve to receive. It does not
insult our intelligence but entertains it. 

- *Chairman  /CEO of Niger Delta Development Commission(NDDC)*! This is 
proper Nigerian Scam. The only thing that could trump this was if it claimed
to be from Nigerian Royalty. Yes, that is as close at this email is from the
absolute apex in the phishing pantheon. This is the kind of email you only
hear about. Remember where you were when you read it.

- The second paragraph is there to set the bait (hence phishing), but when 
it gets to "*huge  contract sum  amounting to Forty Million , Six Hundred and Fourteen Thousand United States of America 
Dollars*", you know
this email delivers! I am sorry; I have no words. I am giggling here.

- Contrary to lesser phishing emails, this one does not scream at you or
pressure you too hard.
There is no trerrible grammar here.
It massages you back by slowly working its con onto
your skin as if it was scented oil. It appeals to your greed, but just with 
the right pressure.

So, savor this email. This is why I look down on so many phishing
emails. When you experience this, you realize comparing this with the
normal mediocricity that floods our mailboxes is like
comparing between have clothes custom made by an European tailor with decades
of experience and something bought at Wal Mart.
