Phishing is everywhere, and it has been increasingly almost exponentially.
Why? Because it works!


# Don't be a phish!
We hope our little phishing website will entertain you, and just maybe
help you learn how to identify
when an email is phishy so you will not be phished.

# We need your help!
Every single email we posted (and make fun of) here is a 100% certified 
phishing 
email. Problem is, we only receive so many of them; it seems phishers do
not like us. We would love to post more, but we can't phillet phishers 
without phishing emails.
This is where *you* can help!

Did you receive a phishing email, or want to know if a suspicious email
is indeed phishy? 
Don't let them spoil your day! Let us turn it into some entertainment!

Send us your
<b><a href="mailto:{{ site.email | encode_email }}" title="Feed the Phish">Phishing Email</a> </b>
so we can phillet it for you!

## Exciting Note
We will remove your identifying information before posting it, 
stating it was contributed by a "viewer like you (thank you!)."
If
you want to be acknowledged for the submission, 
do let us know
how you would like to be called. If you have an avatar or picture you want
use to use when referring to you, do attach it to your email!
